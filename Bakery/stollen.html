                <li>
                    Tip the dried fruit into a small bowl and add the lemon rind and rum.
                    <br>Stir the fruit, then cover the bowl.
                    <br>Leave the fruit for at least 2 hrs or overnight.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make the dough, tip the flour into a bowl and stir in the salt and yeast.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly beat together the butter, milk and egg and add the flour mixture.
                    <br>Mix together to form a soft dough.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 8-10 minutes,
                    <br>until the dough is smooth and elastic.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make a dip in the center of the dough and pour in the fruit and any juices remaining in the bowl.
                    <br><br>
                <li>
                    Knead the fruite into the dough.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll the dough out to about 10"x8".
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knead the marzipan to soften it and then roll it into a long sausage shape, just slightly shorter then the dough.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the marzipan on the dough and then fold the dough over it.
                    <br>Bring the other side of the dough over into the center, to give it a slighly oval shape.

                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the stollen on a buttered baking sheet, and cover it with a light oiled piece of cling film.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leave in a warm place until stollen has doubled in size.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set the oven to 400F.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake the stollen, towards the top of the oven, for 20-30 minutes,
                    <br>or until it sounds hollow when lifted off the baking sheet and tapped underneath.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the stollen from the oven and slide onto a wire rack.
                    <br>Immediately brush over the melted butter and heavily dredge it with powdered sugar.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leave it to cool. The stollen will keep for up to 5-7 werks 
                    <br>if wrapped tighly in a foil and stored in a cool place.
                    <br>Redust with powdered sugar before serving.
