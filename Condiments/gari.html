            <ol>
                <li>
                    Scrape off the ginger peel by running the edge of an upside-down spoon across the surface.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slice each root as thinly as possible with  razor-sharp knife.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the slices in a medium-sized bowl.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you have cut up about half of the ginger, toss in half of the salt and massage gently with your hands to distribute.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let sit for an hour or so and continue cutting the second half of the ginger,
                    <br>following the sme steps as for the first half.
                    <br><i>(salting the first half while you cut the second half helps avoid discoloration)</i>
                    <br><br>
                <li>
                    After the firts half of the ginger has rested in the salt for an hour,
                    <br>lift the slices out from any accumulated liquid and lay out flat
                    <br>on half of a clean kitchen towel, taking care not to break the shapes.
                    <br>Fold the other half of the towel on top of the ginger and press gently
                    <br>to wick out any lingering salt water.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat this step with the second half of the ginger. 
                    <br>Leave the second half in the towel for 10 minutes,
                    <br>then drop all of the ginger slices into a medium-siced bowl.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat the vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan pver medium-high heat,
                    <br>stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved 
                    <br>and the mixture has reached a slow boil.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the heat and immediately pour over the squeezed, salted ginger slices..
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let the vinegared ginger cool naturally before pouring into a clean jar
                    <br>and storing in the refrigerator for several months or more.
                    <br><br>
